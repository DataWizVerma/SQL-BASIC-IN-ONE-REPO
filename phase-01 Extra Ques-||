-- Q1:
-- Write a query to find the names of students whose age is either between 12 and 18 or greater than 25.
-- Display their first_name, last_name, and age. Sort the results by age in ascending order and limit the output to 15 rows
-- Use logical operators and comparison operators in your query.
select first_name , last_name , age from students where age between 12 and 18 or age > 25 order by age limit 15;

-- Q2:
-- Write a query to retrieve the first_name, last_name, and age of students who are not enrolled in classes with class_id 2 or 4. 
-- Use NOT IN to filter the results. 
-- Also, ensure the results are displayed in alphabetical order by last_name.
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, s.age
FROM students s
JOIN student_classes sc ON s.id = sc.student_id
WHERE sc.class_id NOT IN ('2', '4')  -- Use quotes if class_id is a string
ORDER BY s.last_name;

-- Q3:
-- Write a query to find the names and ages of students who are either younger than 10 years or between 18 and 22 years.
-- Use comparison and logical operators.
-- Sort the result by age in descending order and limit the output to 20 rows.

select first_name , age from students where age < 10 or (age BETWEEN 18 AND 22) order by age desc limit 20

-- Q4:
-- Write a query to find the names of students whose first_name starts with the letter 'J' and who are enrolled in classes
-- with class_id not in (1, 3, 5). Use the LIKE and NOT IN operators. Display their first_name, last_name, and class_id,
-- and sort the results by first_name in ascending order.
select s.first_name , s.last_name , sc.class_id from students s
join student_classes sc on s.id=sc.student_id
where s.first_name like 'J%' and sc.class_id not in ('1','3','5') order by s.first_name

select * from student_classes
select * from students
-- Q5:
-- Write a query to find the names of students who are enrolled in at least one class where the class name contains the substring 'Math'.
-- Use the LIKE operator and ensure you join the students, student_classes, and classes tables. Display their first_name, last_name,
-- and class_id.
select s.first_name , s.last_name , sc.class_id  from students s join
student_classes sc on s.id=sc.student_id
