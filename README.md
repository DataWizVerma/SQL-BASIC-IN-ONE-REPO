# SQL Practice Repository

This repository contains SQL practice questions, including basic SQL concepts like DDL and DML, with a focus on database creation and data manipulation. Follow the instructions below to clone the repository and practice SQL questions step by step.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your GitHub username and the repository name.

## Step 2: Open the SQL Files

After cloning, navigate to the folder containing the SQL files. You will find two important files:

1. **`1-DDL_DML-script+(School+DB).sql`**:
   - Open this file and run the SQL commands to create the database and tables.
   - Insert some sample data into the tables.

2. **Second File**:
   - Open the second SQL file and practice step by step. It will guide you through further SQL exercises.

## Step 3: Practice SQL Queries

Follow the instructions in each SQL file and execute them in your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite). The first file will help you understand how to create a database and manipulate data using SQL commands like DDL and DML.

### File Breakdown:

- **`1-DDL_DML-script+(School+DB).sql`**: 
  - Contains SQL commands for creating a database and tables, and inserting data.
  
- **Second SQL File**:
  - Provides additional practice on SQL commands and queries. Follow the instructions in the file to practice queries step by step.
